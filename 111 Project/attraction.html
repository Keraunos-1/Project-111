                <p>Campintac Black Beach No. 2 is the place where US forces landed on October 17, 1944. It was the start of the liberation of the Philippines in World War Two. There is a memorial marker and a small museum. For Filipino people this is a historic landmark. I enjoyed visiting this quiet beach. There is accommodation as well. For history buffs this is a must-see, I would say.</p>

                <h3>Lake Bababu Underwater Cave System</h3>
                <p>If you're up for an adventure, you may try Lake Bababu, it is a 30 minute hike from its beaches and the road going to the lake is very steep and rocky. Might as well prepare your trekking shoes than wearing slippers. The lake is said to be ‘meromictic’ which means that it has both freshwater and seawater and these two layers of water do not mix. Located at Barangay Melgar, Dinagat Islands and is 45 minute boat ride away from San Jose.</p>
